# Tasks
## 0. What is my PID
mandatory

Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.

### Tests
-  <code>./0-what-is-my-pid</code>

Repo:

    GitHub repository: alx-system_engineering-devops
    Directory: 0x05-processes_and_signals
    File: 0-what-is-my-pid
    

## 1. List your processes
mandatory

Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.

Requirements:
-  Must show all processes, for all users, including those which might not have a TTY
-  Display in a user-oriented format
-  Show process hierarchy

### Tests
-  <code>./1-list_your_processes | head -50</code>

Repo:

    GitHub repository: alx-system_engineering-devops
    Directory: 0x05-processes_and_signals
    File: 1-list_your_processes
    

## 2. Show your Bash PID
mandatory

Using your previous exercise command, write a Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.

Requirements:
-  You cannot use pgrep
-  The third line of your script must be # shellcheck disable=SC2009 (for more info about ignoring shellcheck error here)

### Tests
-  <code>./2-show_your_bash_pid</code>
 
Repo:

    GitHub repository: alx-system_engineering-devops
    Directory: 0x05-processes_and_signals
    File: 2-show_your_bash_pid
    

## 3. Show your Bash PID made easy
mandatory

Write a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash.

Requirements:
-  You cannot use ps

### Tests
-  <code>./3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy</code>
-  <code>./3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy</code>
 
Repo:

    GitHub repository: alx-system_engineering-devops
    Directory: 0x05-processes_and_signals
    File: 3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy
    

## 4. To infinity and beyond
mandatory

Write a Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely.

Requirements:
-  In between each iteration of the loop, add a sleep 2

### Tests
-  <code>./4-to_infinity_and_beyond</code>
    -  Note that I ctrl+c (killed) the Bash script in the example.

    GitHub repository: alx-system_engineering-devops
    Directory: 0x05-processes_and_signals
    File: 4-to_infinity_and_beyond
    

## 5. Don't stop me now!

We stopped our 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process using ctrl+c in the previous task, there is actually another way to do this.

Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

Requirements:
-  You must use kill

# Terminal #0
## Tests

## 10. Manage my process
#advanced

-  & <link>https://bashitout.com/2013/05/18/Ampersands-on-the-command-line.html</link>

Programs that are detached from the terminal and running in the background are called daemons or processes, need to be managed. The general minimum set of instructions is: start, restart and stop. The most popular way of doing so on Unix system is to use the init scripts.

Write a manage_my_process Bash script that:
-  Indefinitely writes I am alive! to the file /tmp/my_process
-  In between every I am alive! message, the program should pause for 2 seconds
-  Write Bash (init) script 101-manage_my_process that manages manage_my_process. (both files need to be pushed to git)

Requirements:
-  When passing the argument start:
-  Starts manage_my_process
-  Creates a file containing its PID in <code>/var/run/my_process.pid</code>
-  Displays manage_my_process started
-  When passing the argument stop:
-  Stops manage_my_process
-  Deletes the file <code>/var/run/my_process.pid</code>
-  Displays manage_my_process stopped
-  When passing the argument restart
-  Stops manage_my_process
-  Deletes the file <code>/var/run/my_process.pid</code>
-  Starts manage_my_process
-  Creates a file containing its PID in <code>/var/run/my_process.pid</code>
-  Displays manage_my_process restarted
-  Displays Usage: manage_my_process {start|stop|restart} if any other argument or no argument is passed
-  Note that this init script is far from being perfect (but good enough for the sake of manipulating process and PID file), for example we do not handle the case where we check if a process is already running when doing <code>./101-manage_my_process</code> start, in our case it will simply create a new process instead of saying that it is already started.

### Tests
-  <code>./101-manage_my_process</code>
-  <code>./101-manage_my_process start</code>
-  <code>tail -f -n0 /tmp/my_process</code>
-  <code>sudo ./101-manage_my_process stop</code>
-  <code>cat /var/run/my_process.pid</code>
- <code>tail -f -n0 /tmp/my_process</code>

## 11. Zombie
#advanced
Read what a zombie process is <link>https://zombieprocess.wordpress.com/what-is-a-zombie-process/</link>.

Write a C program that creates 5 zombie processes.

Requirements:
-  For every zombie process created, it displays Zombie process created, PID: ZOMBIE_PID
-  Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
-  When your code is done creating the parent process and the zombies, use the function bellow
    int infinite_while(void)
    {
        while (1)
        {
            sleep(1);
        }
        return (0);
    }
Example:

# Terminal #0
-  <code>gcc 102-zombie.c -o zombie</code>
-  <code>./zombie</code>

# Terminal #1
-  <code>ps aux | grep -e 'Z+.*<defunct>'</code>
 
In Terminal #0, I start by compiling 102-zombie.c and executing zombie which creates 5 zombie processes. In Terminal #1, I display the list of processes and look for lines containing <code>Z+.*<defunct></code> which catches zombie process.
